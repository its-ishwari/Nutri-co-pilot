# 🥗 NutriCoPilot – AI Food Label Reasoning Engine

NutriCoPilot is an AI-native web application that transforms complex food ingredient labels into meaningful health insights.  
Unlike traditional OCR tools, NutriCoPilot acts as a **decision-support system**, analyzing ingredient synergy, inferring user intent, and highlighting real health trade-offs in real time.
